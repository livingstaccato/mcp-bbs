# Legacy Utility Scripts

These scripts are preserved for historical/operator reference and are not part of the supported primary workflow.

Use supported commands instead:

- `bbsbot tw2002 bot ...`
- `bbsbot tw2002 play --mode <full|intelligent|trading|1000turns>`
- `bbsbot script <script_name> [args...]` for scripts kept under `src/bbsbot/commands/scripts/`
